**`Technology Enthusiast / Developer in Training / Gym Rat / English Learner`**

I am a system engineer in training with the desire to become a full-stack developer and always be a better version of myself by learning everything I can about this world of development. Every project that I develop is done consciously and although I know that each one could have been better, I am satisfied with what I have achieved and learned by developing each one.

In the "Repositories" tab you can find some of the projects I have done so you can get an idea of my skills acquired over time on development, from my beginnings to today.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Nicolas Coding Journey
I started my coding journey as a system engineering student where I started to learn a lot of theory, some technologies and languages like Java, C++ and Python, But in my first year of study I realized that the university was not going to teach me everything I wanted to learn and not even what I needed to be a good programmer, so I decided to take charge of my programming training and began to learn by myself (courses, personal projects, videos, internet articles, etc...). As a student of systems engineering and my self-taught learning, I can satisfy the desire to learn everything I can about the programming world (code, internet, theory, networks, etc...). Currently I'm still studying and learning to enter this world, and I just have one thing to say to the programming world... don't neglect yourself, because I'm coming for ya...
